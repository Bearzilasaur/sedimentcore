The primary use of this package is to tidy and sort all of the relevant sediment output data into a table for visualisation with the R studio package ggplot2
Run the Sedimend module from a python interpreter, which will call the other modules for you. 
Then select the appropriate folder or files from the file browser, and then choose an output forlder for the table to be stored in. 
Lastly, open up RStudio and run the SedProcessing r script to select the newly created table and plot it using ggplot2. This will prompt you to select a folder in which to save the two output images in both .svg and .png.
